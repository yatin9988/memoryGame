>The Cabo Card is based on the Chinese game Mao appeared during the nineteenth century.
>Mao (or Mau) is a card game of the shedding family, in which the aim is to get rid of all of the cards in hand without breaking certain unspoken rules.
>The game is from a subset of the Stops family and is similar in structure to the card game Uno or Crazy Eights.
>Invented in 1974, Set has a simple goal: to find special doubles called “sets” within a deck of 81 cards. Each card displays a different design with four attributes—color (which can be red, purple or green), shape (oval, diamond or squiggle), shading (solid, striped or outlined) and number (one, two or three copies of the shape).
>In a typical play, 12 cards are placed face-up and the players search for a set: three cards whose designs, for each attribute, are either all the same or all different.
